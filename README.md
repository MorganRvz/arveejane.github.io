## Python
Title:
A Machine Learning Approach to Weather Prediction in Davao City, Philippines: Integrating K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Objectives:
  1.	To develop a k-NN model that accurately predicts relative humidity based on input variables such as visibility, temperature, pressure, and wind speed using the entire dataset.
  2.	To create groups of data points with similar characteristics using K-means clustering.
  3.	To build k-NN models for each cluster created by K-means clustering.
  4.	To compare the predictive performance of the optimal k-NN model and the cluster-based k-NN models to identify the best-performing approach.

Code for [K-means Clustering integrated with K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)](https://github.com/MorganRvz/Projects/blob/main/Clustering_withKnn.ipynb)

Code for [K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)](https://github.com/MorganRvz/Projects/blob/main/Knn.ipynb)

Conclusion:
The k-NN model applied to the full dataset outperformed the cluster-based approach in predicting relative humidity, suggesting that clustering did not enhance model performance in this case

Title:
Comparative Analysis of Avocado Ripeness Classification Using Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Objectives:
  1. To develop Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
  2. Aims to assess which machine learning algorithm—Random Forest or k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)—yields higher accuracy in classifying the ripeness of avocados.

Code for [Random Forest and k-NN_ Avocado Ripeness Classification](https://github.com/MorganRvz/Projects/blob/main/Random_Forest_and_k-NN_%20Avocado_Ripesness_Classification.ipynb)

Conclusion: Among the two models evaluated, the Random Forest Classifier provided the most accurate and consistent performance, making it the most suitable algorithm for classifying avocado ripeness in this study.
