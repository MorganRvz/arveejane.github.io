## Python
Title:
A Machine Learning Approach to Weather Prediction in Davao City, Philippines: Integrating K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Objective:
  1.	To develop a k-NN model that accurately predicts relative humidity based on input variables such as visibility, temperature, pressure, and wind speed using the entire dataset.
  2.	To create groups of data points with similar characteristics using K-means clustering.
  3.	To build k-NN models for each cluster created by K-means clustering.
  4.	To compare the predictive performance of the optimal k-NN model and the cluster-based k-NN models to identify the best-performing approach.

Code for K-means Clustering integrated with K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): https://github.com/MorganRvz/Projects/blob/main/Clustering_withKnn.ipynb

Code for K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): https://github.com/MorganRvz/Projects/blob/main/Knn.ipynb

Conclusion:
The k-NN model applied to the full dataset outperformed the cluster-based approach in predicting relative humidity, suggesting that clustering did not enhance model performance in this case
