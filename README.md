Title:
A Machine Learning Approach to Weather Prediction in Davao City, Philippines: Integrating K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Objective:
  1.	To develop a k-NN model that accurately predicts relative humidity based on input variables such as visibility, temperature, pressure, and wind speed using the entire dataset.
  2.	To create groups of data points with similar characteristics using K-means clustering.
  3.	To build k-NN models for each cluster created by K-means clustering.
  4.	To compare the predictive performance of the optimal k-NN model and the cluster-based k-NN models to identify the best-performing approach.
