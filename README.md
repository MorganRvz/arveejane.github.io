## Python
Title:
A Machine Learning Approach to Weather Prediction in Davao City, Philippines: Integrating K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Objectives:
  1.	To develop a k-NN model that accurately predicts relative humidity based on input variables such as visibility, temperature, pressure, and wind speed using the entire dataset.
  2.	To create groups of data points with similar characteristics using K-means clustering.
  3.	To build k-NN models for each cluster created by K-means clustering.
  4.	To compare the predictive performance of the optimal k-NN model and the cluster-based k-NN models to identify the best-performing approach.

Conclusion:
The k-NN model applied to the full dataset outperformed the cluster-based approach in predicting relative humidity, suggesting that clustering did not enhance model performance in this case

Title:
Comparative Analysis of Avocado Ripeness Classification Using Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Objectives:
  1. To develop Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
  2. Aims to assess which machine learning algorithm—Random Forest or k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)—yields higher accuracy in classifying the ripeness of avocados.

Conclusion: Among the two models evaluated, the Random Forest Classifier provided the most accurate and consistent performance, making it the most suitable algorithm for classifying avocado ripeness in this study.

Title: Correlational Analysis on Years of Experience and Salary
Objective:
  1. To determine the strength and direction of the linear relationship between years of experience and salary using statistical correlation analysis.

Conclusion: The correlation coefficient between Years of Experience and Salary is approximately 0.98, indicating a very strong positive linear relationship.
This means that as the number of years of experience increases, the salary also tends to increase significantly. 
The strength of this correlation suggests that experience is a major factor influencing salary growth.

Title: Real Estate Price Prediction in the Philippines Using Ensemble and Regularization-Based Machine Learning Models
Objectives:
  1. To preprocess and transform non-normally distributed variables, including applying a logarithmic transformation to the target variable (Price), and handle missing values appropriately.
  2. To evaluate the predictive performance of four machine learning models—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest—for estimating property prices in the Philippines.
  3. To compare the models’ performance using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Coefficient of Determination (R²).
  4. To perform cluster analysis on property features (e.g., Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Floor Area, Land Area, Latitude, and Longitude) to identify distinct groups of properties.

Conclusion:  The KNN model showed solid performance in predicting property prices, with an RMSE of 3.91, R² of 0.75, and MAE of 3.76 on the test set, indicating a good but slightly imperfect fit. In comparison, Ridge Regression achieved an RMSE of 0.50, R² of 0.84, and MAE of 0.33, demonstrating a better fit with lower prediction errors. Lasso Regression had similar results to Ridge, with an RMSE of 0.50, R² of 0.84, and MAE of 0.38, suggesting that both regularized regression models handled the data effectively. On the other hand, the Random Forest model excelled with an RMSE of 0.40, R² of 0.90, and MAE of 0.25, outperforming the KNN, Ridge, and Lasso models, showcasing its ability to handle complex relationships in the data.
